# TransAn
A Transcript Analysis Application

A Java application that asks the user to copy his Transcript's source page, from that it builds a table presenting: Semester GPA (Calculated), Cumulative GPA (Fetched from the Page) and % change of the CGPA across semesters.   Then it provides a Simple line Graph showing the trend.
